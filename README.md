# DYNAMIC PCU CALCULATION

## Overview:
The term ‘Passenger Car Unit (PCU)’, used in transportation engineering, is a metric that is used to measure the rate of traffic flow on a highway. In other words, the PCU can be referred to as a measure of the impact that a mode of transport has on a traffic variable, with reference to the impact of passenger cars.

## Objective:
The objective of this application is to estimate the Dynamic PCU, from the input files provided by the user, and provide the output of the Dynamic PCU, in the time intervals, as specified by the user.
